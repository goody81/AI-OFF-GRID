### 🧠 Key Components

*   **Project Talos (Autonomous Guardian):** The overarching AIOps system responsible for managing, healing, and evolving the entire stack. Built with a focus on resilience using principles from historical computing.
*   **Rust Agent Ecosystem:** A suite of specialized, high-performance agents written in Rust for tasks like repository mining, system monitoring, automated updates, and task execution.
*   **Specialized SLMs:** Four distinct Small Language Models optimized for specific functions: Browser, Mobile, Home Automation, and Voice Interaction.
*   **Voice AI Enhancement:** State-of-the-art voice processing including far-field microphones, wake-word detection, real-time cloning (VALL-E X), emotional prosody, and on-device privacy.
*   **1000-Rule Framework:** A comprehensive legal, ethical, and operational governance layer covering AI ethics, privacy, security, home automation protocols, off-grid operations, and legal compliance.

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

*   **Hardware:**
    *   1x High-end x86_64 CPU/Server (e.g., latest Intel/AMD workstation/server CPU) - Main Hub
    *   4x Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB/8GB RAM) - Distributed Nodes
    *   Industrial-grade networking gear (PoE+ Switch, WiFi 7 Mesh Router)
    *   Off-Grid Power System (Solar panels, Charge Controller, Battery Bank, Pure Sine Wave Inverter)
    *   Professional Audio Hardware (Microphone Arrays, Audio Processors)
    *   Compatible Home Automation Devices (Matter/Zigbee/Thread/Z-Wave)
*   **Software:**
    *   Linux OS (e.g., Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS on Hub, Ubuntu Core 22.04 on Pi Nodes)
    *   Docker & Docker Compose
    *   Kubernetes (e.g., MicroK8s or K3s) cluster across Hub and Pi Nodes
    *   Rust Toolchain (1.70+) for agent development
    *   Python 3.11+ for AI model scripts and utilities
    *   Git, Git LFS

### 🚀 Quick Start (Conceptual)

*⚠️ Warning: This is a complex, enterprise-grade system. Full deployment requires significant technical expertise, hardware resources, and time.*

1.  **Acquire Hardware:** Source all components as per `hardware/components/`.
2.  **Assemble Hardware:** Follow instructions in `hardware/assembly/`.
3.  **Install OS:** Install Linux OS on Hub and Pi nodes according to `software/README.md`.
4.  **Configure Networking:** Set up the local network and ensure all nodes can communicate.
5.  **Deploy Infrastructure:** Use scripts/manifests in `execution/deployment/` to set up Docker, Kubernetes, and core services.
6.  **Deploy AI & Agents:** Deploy the SLMs, Voice AI stack, and Rust agents onto the cluster.
7.  **Integrate Automation:** Configure home automation protocols and devices.
8.  **Configure 1000-Rule Framework:** Apply governance rules via `docs/legal/`.
9.  **Test & Validate:** Run tests as outlined in `execution/testing/`.
